My dissertation, “Constellations of Indigeneity: The Political Obligations and Promise of Conceptions of Indigeneity,” argues that there is a failure to appreciate the importance of particular conceptions of indigeneity, which establish differing obligations on the state and indigenous communities. Examining New Zealand’s response to indigenous rights, I draw on policy documents, newspaper articles and interviews with indigenous leaders to demonstrate that appeals to indigeneity are a prominent component of political claims. Some conceptions of indigeneity provide legitimacy, yet others prove limiting, especially when framed as rights. *I use comparative analysis to apply these findings to the ‘Anglosphere’ (Australia, Canada, the United States), arguing that similar features can be seen across these cases, with context-specific exceptions.*

These effects invite normative consideration of definitions of indigeneity, and I propose drawing on Theodor Adorno’s suggestion that we ‘think in constellations’ to highlight the unique experience and history of different understandings of indigeneity. Exploring these constellations opens the possibility for more nuanced assessments about the nature of indigenous politics, allowing us to challenge essentialized identities and knowledge.
