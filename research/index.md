## My research
Synopsis of my research interests. Dissertation, gender politics, etc.  

**Need to shorten the explanation of my dissertation to a paragraph or two. Explain what it is and how it contributes to the current literature. Also point to my interest in gender politics, and where I see my project going in the next few years.**

### Dissertation summary
Despite international recognition of the importance of indigenous rights, as evidenced by the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007, indigenous communities continue to face obstacles to acknowledgement of and restitution for their grievances. These obstacles stem in part from a lack of clarity about the nature of indigeneity itself: what makes a person or a group indigenous, and why might indigeneity uniquely confer particular rights?  

The concept of indigeneity has received limited scholarly attention in political theory yet, without an understanding of what indigeneity entails, the grounds for restitution are unreliable. My dissertation seeks to address this deficit by tackling two key questions. First, how have conceptions of indigeneity been used to promote or reject policies supportive of indigenous rights? Second, how might particular local, national, or international conceptions of indigeneity provide greater promise for justice?  

To answer the first question I draw on original archival research in Archives New Zealand to show that particular conceptions of indigeneity establish differing obligations on the state and indigenous communities. Utilizing Rogers Smith’s work on ‘peoplehood’ as a theoretical basis for understanding how concepts impose binding duties on individuals and states, I argue that appeals to indigeneity are a prominent component of contentious political issues in New Zealand and elsewhere. Some of these formulations provide legitimacy, both domestically and internationally. Others, however, prove limiting, especially when framed as rights. These ramifications challenge us to more carefully consider our understandings of, and appeals to, indigeneity.  

In answering the second question, I turn to political theory literature on identity, justice and rights. Having empirically surveyed global, national and local conceptions of indigeneity and their effects in a New Zealand context, I identify common links between particular conceptions and political outcomes. I argue that while clearly defined ‘bounded’ notions of indigeneity may provide some indigenous communities with political resources, their harmful effects are often overlooked. For this reason, I propose utilizing Theodor Adorno’s suggestion that we ‘think in constellations’ to highlight the unique experience and history of different conceptions of indigeneity. Rather than focusing solely on identifying specific features of indigeneity, I suggest that we look to the constellations of concepts that evoke indigeneity in order to reconsider the possibilities of indigenous rights and politics.

**Project’s importance**  
My dissertation offers a timely contribution to indigenous studies that has implications for work on group identity, justice, and rights in a range of disciplines. The project scrutinizes a foundational concept of literature on historical injustice. Much of this literature assumes that indigeneity is a legitimate, important feature of rights claims without questioning what indigeneity actually is. This is problematic, because defining indigeneity has at least two important consequences: a) it affects who has access to resources or rights reserved for indigenous peoples, and b) it shapes the kinds of privileges and resources available to indigenous peoples. I offer a focused genealogy of indigeneity, highlighting moments when use of the concept can be seen to influence political outcomes. This work provides the foundation for more accurate theories of historical injustice and understandings of indigenous identity.  

This project also provides valuable theoretical resources for improved policy-making in indigenous and multicultural communities. Greater understanding of the interaction between conceptions of indigeneity and public policy has both theoretical and practical significance for indigenous peoples and policy-makers. Rather than offering an ideal theory that might bear little resemblance to reality, my dissertation draws on original archival research and interviews, ensuring that my theory is grounded in empirically valid claims. The multifaceted research approach allows me to generate realistic, normative suggestions for particular conceptions of indigeneity, which might be leveraged by indigenous communities and individuals to yield politically desirable outcomes.

I have also published on gender politics, applying the international literature on gender gaps in women's presence, status and outcomes in academia to New Zealand's political science community.
