**Constellations of Indigeneity: The Political Obligations and Promise of Conceptions of Indigeneity**  
Despite international recognition of indigenous rights, there is a failure to appreciate the importance of particular conceptions of indigeneity, which I argue establish differing obligations on the state and indigenous communities. Examining New Zealand’s response to indigenous rights, I draw on policy documents, newspaper articles and interviews with indigenous leaders to demonstrate that appeals to indigeneity are a prominent component of political claims. Some conceptions of indigeneity provide legitimacy, yet others prove limiting, especially when framed as rights. These effects challenge us to more carefully consider our appeals to indigeneity. Further, they invite consideration of the normative dimension of indigeneity – how particular conceptions might provide greater promise for justice.

### Research interests
