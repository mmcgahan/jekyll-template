## Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Virginia
I am a New Zealand Fulbright student working towards my doctorate in Political Theory at the University of Virginia.

My dissertation, “Constellations of Indigeneity: The Political Obligations and Promise of Conceptions of Indigeneity,” explores differing conceptions of indigeneity and the obligations they establish on the state and indigenous communities.

I received my BA in Political Science and History from Victoria University of Wellington and my MSc in Political Theory from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
