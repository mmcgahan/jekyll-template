## Future Courses
I participated in a week-long workshop run by the [UVa Teaching Resource Center](http://trc.virginia.edu/home.htm), designing an upper-level undergraduate syllabus on theories of equality based on learner-centered principles. I am now applying such teaching and learning principles to other courses I design. Below I have listed a sample of courses that I could teach, including some draft syllabi.
