### After Modernity: Criticial Theorists and Emancipatory Politics

**Political Science and International Relations Department**  
**Victoria University of Wellington** *[victoria.ac.nz](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/)*  
*Lecturer*

While I was conducting research in New Zealand, I worked as a Lecturer for an International Relations/Political Theory course at Victoria University of Wellington. This class consisted of approximately 60 upper-level undergraduate students. As lecturer, I designed the course, planned and delivered lectures, devised and graded student assignments, mentored students.
