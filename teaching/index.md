# Teaching

## Lecturer

### Political Science and International Relations Department 

#### Victoria University of Wellington (hyperlink?)

While I was conducting research in New Zealand, I worked as a Lecturer for an International Relations/Political Theory course at Victoria University of Wellington. This class consisted of approximately 60 upper-level undergraduate students. As lecturer, I designed the course, planned and delivered lectures, devised and graded student assignments, mentored students.
