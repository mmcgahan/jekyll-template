## Future Courses
I participated in a week-long workshop run by the [UVa Teaching Resource Center](http://trc.virginia.edu/home.htm), designing an upper-level undergraduate course on theories of equality based on learner-centered principles. I am now applying such teaching and learning principles to other courses I design. Below is a sample of courses that I could teach, including some draft syllabi.

#### Undergraduate
- [Introduction to Political Theory]({{site.baseurl}}docs/Intro_June2013.pdf)
- Modern Political Theory
- [Desperate Times, Equal Measures? Equality and Difference in Politics]({{site.baseurl}}docs/Equalities_May2013.pdf)
- [After Modernity: Critical Theorists and Emancipatory Politics]({{site.baseurl}}docs/CriticalTheory_June2013.pdf)

#### Graduate
- [Methods in Political Theory]({{site.baseurl}}docs/Methods_June2013.pdf)
